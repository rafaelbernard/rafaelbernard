# Some random things about quality and velocity tools for Software Engineering

A list of my dev preferences (choosen or unavoidable) for software engineering.

## PHP world

* Frameworks
    * Symfony
        * Complex applications, with multiple domains
        * Works for simple application as well as Laravel is based on lots of symfony components
    * Laravel
        * Works for lots of applications, more the simple ones, but also works for complex
        * The ecosystem is huge and growing
* Tools
  * SonarCloud
    * Works for a variety of languages. Has a great coverage for code smells, code quality.
    * Does not have a free tier
  * Deepsource
    * patterns, static analysis
    * has a free tier
    * no code coverage for php yet

## JS world

* Frameworks
    * Vue
        * All websites
* Tools
    * MSW - Mock API calls
        * All websites
        * Front-end or back-end

## Other tools

* http://bugsnag.com: Great tool for software stability. Great error monitoring dashboard and traces.
  - php, apm, free-tier
* http://deepsource.io: Quality and velocity tool. Check for patterns, static analysis, code coverage. Does a great code analysis for PHP, but there is no code coverage yet.
  - php, static analysis, free-tier
